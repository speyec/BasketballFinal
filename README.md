# BasketballFinal
Database final SQL group project |
Michael Ouatu and Brendan Quigly | 
We created a basketball database for the LA Lakers and created 4 different tables with different primary keys as well as populating the tables with insert statements. |

Distribution of work: For the design portion of the project, Michael created the schema and ER diagram. Brendan did the project summary, business rules, and information search. Moving on, for the implementation of the design, Michael created the tables and Brendan created the insertion statements. Then, both of us created queries to demo the database with, and created the slideshow.
